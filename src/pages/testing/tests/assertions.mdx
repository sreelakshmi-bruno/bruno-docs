# Assertions

Assertions allow you to declaratively write tests.

This should cover most of your testing needs. For complex tests, you can write test scripts.

## Getting Started with Assertions

To get started with basic tests using assertions, follow these steps:

1.  **Open a Collection**: Navigate to the Collection containing the request you want to test.
2.  **Select a Request**: Click on a request within the Collection.
3.  **Go to the Assertions Tab**: Click on the Assertions tab to access the testing interface.
4.  **Write Your Test**: You can now specify an **expression**, an **operator**, and the **value** to test against the API response.

This method allows you to quickly test different conditions and verify that the API returns the expected results.

### Example:

- **Expression**: Verify the body response status (e.g., response.body.status).
- **Operator**: Choose the operator (e.g., equals, contains).
- **Value**: Provide the expected value (e.g., 200).

Bruno will then automatically run the test and give you the results, letting you know if the assertion passes or fails.
